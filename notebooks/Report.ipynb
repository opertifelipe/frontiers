    "The task consists to develop an algorithm that, given a scientific paper (or a simple text/report), it recommends the most suitable Frontiers journals. Several methodology could be used to define the best recommendation system and classifier. However, it strongly depends by the number of classes (Frontiers Journals) to be predicted. A previous study ([Meijer et al. *Document Embedding for Scientific Articles:\n",
    "Efficacy of Word Embeddings vs TFIDF.* 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.05151.pdf)), already compare document embeddings using TFIDF and WordEmbeddings for classification of huge dataset of scientific papers (70 milion) into  30 thousand distinct journals or conferences.\n",
